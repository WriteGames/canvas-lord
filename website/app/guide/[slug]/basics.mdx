# Canvas Lord Basics

## ...what is Canvas Lord?

Canvas Lord is an HTML5 "game tutorial engine" built for use on <a href="http://writegames.com">WriteGames.com</a>. It leverages the HTML5 `<canvas>` element and JavaScript to create interactive experiences that can tap into the HTML on the page, such as input sliders that adjust a value in the game.

The source code for the engine is available at [github.com/WriteGames/canvas-lord](https://github.com/WriteGames/canvas-lord)

**_Warning: While the engine has many features, it is still a work-in-progress! Things <s>will likely</s> may break or change._**

## 0. Pre-requisites

[in-progress] - you will need to be able to spin up a lil' web server (`XAMPP`, `npm serve`, `python -m http.server`, etc)

## 1. Get The Engine

Download `canvas-lord-v0.6.1-with-template.zip` from the Assets section of the [latest release](https://github.com/WriteGames/canvas-lord/releases/latest). Create a new folder with the name of your project (we'll use `/my-game` in this tutorial) and unzip the contents of the ZIP file within `/my-game`.

If you navigate to your localhost, you should see a canvas with a dark gray background:

### The Files:

`index.html` is the webpage for your game. It pulls styles from `css/styles.css` to position the canvas, and imports `js/game.js` which contains the code for your game.

Opening up `js/game.js` will give us the following:

export const step1Snippet = `\
import { Game } from './canvas-lord.js';

const game = new Game('my-game');
game.start();
`;

<CodeSnippet>{step1Snippet}</CodeSnippet>

## 2. Create a Scene & Entity

export const step2Snippet = `\
import { Game, Scene, Entity } from 'canvas-lord';
import { Sprite } from 'canvas-lord/graphic';

const game = new Game('my-game');

const scene = new Scene();
game.pushScene(scene);

const entity = new Entity(20, 20);
entity.addGraphic(Sprite.createRect(32, 32, 'red'));
scene.addEntity(entity);

game.start();
`;

<CodeSnippet>{step2Snippet}</CodeSnippet>

Output:

<Canvas
	id="my-game"
	src="basics/003-create-scene-entity.js"
	width={320}
	height={180}
	pixel
/>
